Hi! My name is Stas, and I am a data engineer who loves turning chaos into order and data into insights. My superpower is transforming raw data into meaningful information. I have a knack for finding patterns and trends in even the most complex datasets. 

With a background in computer science and experience working with a variety of data storage technologies, I am skilled at designing and implementing efficient data pipelines for ETL processes, but always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of data engineering. I am also comfortable working with cloud computing platforms like AWS and GCP. 

I am really fond of open-source development, primarily [Airflow repository](https://github.com/apache/airflow)

- I’m currently learning C, Rust, and Front-End
- I’m currently working on a Lead Data Engineer role at Innowise Group
- I like to create music, go to the gym, and a swimming pool
- Ask me about business and programming
- Fun fact: I was a music producer in the past
